This repo is my workspace while going through the book: "Learn to Code by Solving Problems" by Daniel Zingaro.

I'm just starting to actually work through it, but the completeness and specifity work for me.

Some aspects kind of clash with our class process - examples are all based on working in a shell, so things generate results without enclosing in print function, and several things work use input process. Of course could do those in the shell, but I'm just staying within Spyder and/or Jupyter Lab to increase familiarity, and modifying as I go. But can feel like more work than it's worth, especially since it's all a bit confusing yet. 

Also the end-of-chapter work involves submitting things to judging websites, which are new to me! May write more about that later.
